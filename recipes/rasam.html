        <ol>To begin making Arachuvitta Rasam Recipe, soak the lemon sized tamarind in warm water for 10 minutes and squeeze out the tamarind pulp. Keep this extract aside.</ol>
        <ol>Also, soak the toor dal for 30 minutes and grind it along with the cumin seeds and red chilli to a fine paste using a hand mixer.</ol>
        <ol>Now, take a wok/kadai add the tamarind extract, chopped tomatoes, slit green chilli and turmeric powder, enough water and boil until the tomatoes are well cooked and the raw smell of the tamarind goes away.</ol>
        <ol>Add the ground toor dal mix, season with salt and simmer for another 10 minutes.</ol>
        <ol>If the mixture becomes too thick, add water at this stage to your desired consistency and let the mix comes to a rolling boil. Switch off the flame.</ol>
        <ol>Heat ghee in a small tadka pan, add the mustard seeds and let it crackle.</ol>
        <ol>Roughly hand pound the cumin and pepper corns using a mortar and pestle and add it to the tadka along with the curry leaves and asafoetida.</ol>
        <ol>Once the curry leaves crackle, switch off the flame and transfer this tadka to the pan in which you have cooked the rasam.</ol>
        <ol>Garnish with roughly torn coriander leaves and serve the Arachuvitta Rasam Recipe with steamed rice and beans carrot poriyal for a weeknight dinner.</ol>
